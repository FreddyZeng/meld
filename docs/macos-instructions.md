# macOS Instructions


These instructions are designed to allow 
technically proficient users of macOS operating systems 
to be able to make some use of 
the upstream GNOME Meld project code. 

## Introduction

The Meld project does NOT currently support the 
Apple macOS operating system family. 
Neither Apple Mac computer architecture is supported, 
legacy Intel (x64) processors 
nor the newer Apple Silicon (Arm) CPUs. 

There have been fork projects that have produced builds 
to allow the macOS user base to install and run 
binaries based on the Meld project, 
but unfortunately these have not enjoyed 
the same level of development and maintenance effort 
as the multi-resource upstream team 
under the GNOME umbrella. 

This small work-package is starting a minor branch. 
The hope is to attract interest amongst the macOS community 
around the upstream Meld project. 
If it can draw potential development, 
testing, maintenance and support resources into the 
main GNOME Meld project, then they would be able to work together, 
within the existing project structure. 

The envisioned result is a formally-supported macOS build 
that can be delivered through common package management channels, 
to allow the macOS user community to benefit from 
the great features that have resulted from historic development efforts.
